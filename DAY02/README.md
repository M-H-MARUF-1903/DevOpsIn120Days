### **#120DaysOfDevOps | Day 2: DevOps Lifecycle & Practices**

### **Today's Mission:**

Understand the  **end-to-end DevOps lifecycle**  and how industry giants like Netflix/Amazon use these practices to deploy code  **1000x/day**.

----------

### **The Big Picture (With Pizza!)**

Imagine building a pizza restaurant  **the DevOps way**:

1.  **Order Received**  (Plan) â†’  We need 100 pizzas in 1 hour!
    
2.  **Chefs Code Recipes**  (Develop) â†’  Let's automate toppings!
    
3.  **Robot Kitchen**  (Build/Test) â†’  Oops, robot added pineapple? Fix it FAST!
    
4.  **Instant Delivery**  (Deploy) â†’  Drones deliver pizzas in 2 mins!
    
5.  **Customer Feedback**  (Monitor) â†’  People love extra cheese? Add more!
    

**This is DevOps lifecycle - no waiting, no chaos!**

----------

### The 7 DevOps Practices (With Real Examples):

1.  **Continuous Planning**
    
    -   Tools: Jira, Trello, ASANA, XLSX, Google Sheets, Notion etc
        
    -   Example: Netflix plans features  **based on what users binge-watch**.
        
2.  **Continuous Development**
    
    -   Tools: Git, VS Code
        
    -   Fact: Developers/engineers write  **small chunks of code**  (not 1000-line monsters!) and create a version (git commit).
        
3.  **Continuous Testing**
    
    -   Tools: Selenium, Jest, PyTest etc
        
    -   Fun Fact: Amazon runs  **1000s of tests in minutes**  before deployment.
        
4.  **Continuous Integration (CI)**
    
    -   Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI etc
	       - **Jenkins**  =  **Old-school pizza oven**  (powerful but needs manual setup).
    
		-   **GitHub Actions**  =  **Microwave**  (built into your kitchen/GitHub).
    
		-   **CircleCI**  =  **Food delivery app**  (fast, optimized, but costs extra).
        
	  **Context:** Merge like a happy family, no conflicts allowed!
        
5.  **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
    
    -   Tools: ArgoCD, Spinnaker
        
    -   Mind Blown: Netflix deploys  **code every 5 seconds**!
        
6.  **Continuous Monitoring**
    
    -   Tools: Prometheus, Grafana
        
    -   Example: If your app crashes,  **auto-fix it before users notice!**
        
7.  **Continuous Feedback**
    
    -   Tools: Email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty
        
    -   Golden Rule:  **Blame the code, not the coder!**
        

----------

### **Hands-On Tasks (No Cloud Needed!):**

1.  **CI/CD Simulation**:
    
    -   Use GitHub Actions to  **auto-run tests**  when you push code.
        
    -   Task: Create a GitHub repository with a Python script + GitHub Action to test it.
        
2.  **Blame Culture Fix**:
    
    -   Find a  **"Itâ€™s not my fault!"**  moment in your team.
        
    -   Suggest  **one DevOps fix**  (e.g., shared dashboards).
        
3.  **Tool Exploration**:
    
    -   Pick  **one tool**  (Jenkins/Prometheus) and find  **one weird fact**  about it.
        
    -   Example: Jenkins was originally called  _"Hudson"_!

###  Interview Qs of the Day:

1.  Whatâ€™s the difference between CI and CD?
    
2.  How would you explain "Infrastructure as Code to a restaurant chef?"
    
3.  Why is monitoring called the â€˜heartâ€™ of DevOps?
